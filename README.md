Steven Velozo's Resume
======

A resume in LaTeX.  Both brief and extended versions.  Simple make file.

This resume uses the excellent [tufte-latex class library](https://code.google.com/p/tufte-latex/) for right column liner notes.

To build the resume from the command-line, run "make all", "make resume" or "make resume-extended".  To clean up, "make clean" will get rid of ancillary files from the compiler and "make clean-all" will get rid of everything but the source.
