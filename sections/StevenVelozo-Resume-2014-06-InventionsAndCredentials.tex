\section{\mhstandout{Trade Secrets \& Upcoming Patents}}
After mutual nondisclosure is in place, there are a number of documents in my portfolio which are not yet public domain.  These documented trade secrets describe algorithms and methodologies which will never be disclosed as public domain, but are indicative of the calibre and type of software development work I'm capable of.  An in-person review of these materials can be arranged.

\section{Current \mhstandout{Visas}}
My passport has current extended stay business visas for many of the most challenging to get countries including China, Brazil and Argentina.  Business travel has taken me to four continents and 36 countries as well as all fifty US states in the last 10 years.  This exposure to varying national and international cultures gives me strong advantages building localized and culturalized products and business relationships.
