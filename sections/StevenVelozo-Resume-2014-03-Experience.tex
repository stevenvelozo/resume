\subsection{\textbf{Board Member \& Cofounder} at \shstandout{DocuCluster, Inc.} \shyears{[2011-PRESENT]}}
DocuCluster\footnote{\href{http://www.docucluster.com/}{The DocuCluster Site:}\\http://bit.ly/1cCOAVO} is a vertical market software company in the oil \& gas exploration industry.  Originally this was an informal collaboration with my cofounder to research automatically generating graphs of complex textual documents via OCR.  This has blossomed into a great ``when we want to'' weekend job for stretching the brain in a very complex problem space.  Entirely self-funded, we aren't in a hurry to grow a huge organization, instead focusing on designing and building quality products.  My work at DocuCluster has \pstandout{been a revelation in understanding systems for presenting large bodies of complex search results to users in a meaningful way}.

Using modern technologies such as Lucene, Solr, neo4j, node.js and mapnik we provide real-time access to complex reports uniting huge bodies of data.  The standard industry process for assembling these reports requires multiple departments and weeks of lead time.

\subsection{\textbf{Head of Software} at \shstandout{Promethean, Inc.} \shyears{[2010-2014]}}
Promethean\sidenote{\href{http://www.prometheanworld.com/}{Promethean, Inc. Site}\\ http://bit.ly/Ls8dug} is a global education technology company, primarily in the interactive whiteboard business.  When Promethean acquired SynapticMash, I shifted into the Chief Architect position at Promethean.  My first task was to retool the SynapticMash education software platform to be a part of the Promethean product ethos; this product became ActivProgress.  Over the course of four years my responsibilities grew, ultimately running teams in three global locations delivering five distinct software product lines.  These products included:
\begin{itemize}

Much of my work at Promethean was entirely strategic\footnote{\href{http://prezi.com/v-jhcxlibwka/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share}{Strategy Council Prezi}\\ http://bit.ly/1bdyeTS}.  I regularly traveled internationally to localize and culturalize our software products.  As well I ushered the global software team through a time of deep organizational change, merging three isolated software divisions as we shifted from one executive regime to another (Promethean had a change of CEO in 2012).  My experience at Promethean, a public global corporation, \pstandout{provided new skills and tools for working in and with large companies}.

\subsection{\textbf{Chief Architect} at \shstandout{SynapticMash LLC} \shyears{[2008-2010]}}
SynapticMash\footnote{\href{http://www.crunchbase.com/company/synapticmash}{SynapticMash on Crunchbase}\\ http://bit.ly/Ls8EVh} was an education software company focused on data analytics, social networking and classroom engagement.  I was hired before investment series A closed.  I designed and built the entire technology organization\footnote{\href{http://synapticmash.com/index.php/about}{The SynapticMash Executive Team}\\ http://bit.ly/1b8NfX3} including software architecture, products and hosting infrastructure.

My responsibilities at SynapticMash included:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep-0.5em
\item{Hiring the entire software design, development and delivery teams}
\item{Capturing and documenting product specifications}
\item{Defining and documenting software and hosting architecture}

\item{Managing the patent portfolio}
\item{Delivering software products}
\item{Building and maintaining strategic partnerships}
\item{Reporting SDLC progress to investors and the board}
\item{Presenting our technology vision externally at conferences}
\end{itemize}

SynapticMash was my \pstandout{first experience building an organization and delivering products within a venture capital funded company}.  We sold\footnote{\href{http://www.inc.com/news/articles/2010/07/synapticmash-acquired-by-promethean.html}{The SynapticMash Transaction}\\ http://bit.ly/1i7qeeQ} to Promethean, Inc. in 2010 where I continued my executive leadership position.

\subsection{\textbf{CTO \& Cofounder} at \shstandout{Sound Designs LLC} \shyears{[2006-2008]}}
Sound Designs was a New York-based branding, web design, software development and hosting business catering to music companies\footnote{\href{https://web.archive.org/web/20060215201617/http://www.dangelicoguitars.com/guitars.php?}{D'Angelico Guitars Web Site}\\ http://bit.ly/1dwsbwV}, musicians\footnote{\href{https://web.archive.org/web/20070616015006/http://undeadpunk.com/}{The Undead Web Site}\\ http://bit.ly/1adVhDm}, supermodels and visual artists.  We developed an in-house content management and calendaring system tied to a skinnable actionscript streaming audio player to create online presence for bands.  This was my \pstandout{first time dealing with highly internationalized products}-- some\marginnote{With customers such as D'Angelico Guitars, this business was great for growing my guitar collection.} sites had distinct language and culturization requirements when viewed in English, French, Spanish and Arabic.

\subsection{\textbf{CTO \& Founder} at \shstandout{Opus Designs LLC} \shyears{[1997-2008]}}
Opus Designs started as a vehicle for packaging and reselling software and tools I built during my experiences running Office Centers.  Eventually it evolved into a bespoke software company, primarily bringing in revenue via licensable software technologies.  These libraries, products and services most often dealt with large-scale data analytics and scalability.  We used a wide variety of technologies to build bespoke software and specialized systems across many platforms.

\begin{marginfigure}%
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{OpusSite}
  \caption{Opus Designs site 2007}
  \label{fig:OpusSite}
\end{marginfigure}
We billed ourselves as an artisan shop for solving complex problems with technology.  The resulting vertical market software solutions were delivered around recurring revenue licensing models, some as stand-alone applications and others providing SDKs for customers to build upon.  A few of the more interesting problems we solved included:
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep-0.5em
\item{Applying grid solvers to massive databases to compute optimized sales playbooks for broadcast advertising.}
\item{Using GPS\marginnote{Many of these advanced algorithm-based projects were first written in C++, then rewritten in Haskell or Lisp.} and time-of-day drive time statistics to optimize mix levels and agitation speed for material delivery (e.g. cement).}
\item{Delivering emails from queued flat files, allowing legacy software to emit messages to the internet without rewrite.}
\item{Working with internet software companies having trouble scaling their technology and teams.}
\item{Writing custom drivers and interfaces for Linux embedded devices.}
\end{itemize}

The work at Opus Designs allowed me to \pstandout{further understand and hone my ability to intentionally drive a strategic balance between technology management, people management and business model}.

\subsection{\textbf{Vice President \& Cofounder} at \shstandout{Office Centers Inc.} \shyears{[1995-1999]}}
Office Centers was a fully staffed professional services executive suite with offices in Lynnwood, Seattle and Everett.  As the Vice President and Cofounder my time was spent \marginnote{It became evident at this organization that I did not enjoy managing low wage/high turnover staff.  This was the primary reason I moved on.}managing contracts, hiring employees and building technology to keep us ahead of the market.  This was the \pstandout{first organization where my responsibilities included building a team and organizational culture}.

\subsection{\textbf{Graphic Designer} at  \shstandout{MBA Press} \shyears{[1993-1995]}}
MBA Press was a tiny independent printing press near Santa Cruz, California.  My tasks there involved designing print materials, processing imagery in a professional press darkroom and running machinery such as printing presses.  Working in a structured environment like a press with dedicated phases of product \pstandout{gave me a good sense for project and organizational abstraction}.

\subsection{\textbf{Intern, Consultant} at \shstandout{BDI Distributing Inc.} \shyears{[1990-1993]}}
BDI was a small service-oriented computer consultancy\marginnote{Between 1990 and 1993 I had the opportunity to visit and explore Comdex Las Vegas, which in those days was the trade show to be at for learning the technology craft.} with customers all across the Pacific Northwest.  As a networking consultant at BDI Distributing I was tasked with building and configuring IBM PC clones, building and managing LANs and developing custom software.  Of note I \pstandout{designed, developed and shipped my first networked database software in 1992} from BDI: a turn-key replacement for time cards using monochrome touch-screen displays and the Btrieve/Novell database engine.
